# Blockchain Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases four blockchain projects I’ve built to learn and demonstrate smart contract development, decentralized finance, and frontend–blockchain integration.

## 1. Custom ERC-20 Token

### Overview
Created and deployed a custom ERC-20 token on the Ethereum testnet using Solidity. The token follows the ERC-20 standard for transfers, approvals, and balances.

### Highlights
- Mintable and transferable token
- Name, symbol, and total supply configuration
- Deployed and tested on Goerli/Ropsten testnet

### Tech Stack
Solidity · Remix IDE · MetaMask · Ethereum Testnet

---

## 2. DeFi Lending Platform

### Overview
A decentralized lending platform that allows users to deposit ERC-20 tokens and borrow against their deposits.

### Highlights
- Deposit and borrow ERC-20 tokens
- Track total deposits and total borrowed
- Uses Solidity structs for user balances

### Tech Stack
Solidity · OpenZeppelin Contracts (IERC20) · MetaMask · Ethereum Testnet

---

## 3. MyToken Frontend Integration

### Overview
Integrated the custom ERC-20 token with a simple web frontend, enabling users to view balances and transfer tokens without Remix.

### Highlights
- Display wallet balances
- Transfer tokens directly from the frontend
- Connect wallet with MetaMask

### Tech Stack
HTML · CSS · JavaScript · Web3.js/Ethers.js · MetaMask

---

## 4. Blockchain Wallet Interaction & Testing

### Overview
A project focused on connecting wallets to the blockchain and testing token operations via a frontend interface.

### Highlights
- Connect multiple wallets
- Read token balances and simulate transactions
- Handle pending transactions and confirmations on testnet

### Tech Stack
Solidity · HTML/CSS/JS · Web3.js/Ethers.js · MetaMask · Ethereum Testnet

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- ERC-20 token development and deployment
- Smart contract state management and DeFi concepts
- Frontend–blockchain integration using Web3.js/Ethers.js
- Practical wallet integration and testnet transaction flow

## How to Explore
Each project folder contains its own Solidity contracts and/or frontend code.  
Follow these steps to run locally:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project folder you’re interested in.
3. Deploy the Solidity contract with Remix or your preferred tool.
4. Connect MetaMask to the testnet and interact via the frontend (if provided).
