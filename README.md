A basic smart contract developed in Solidity that allows users to transfer tokens between accounts. This project demonstrates basic blockchain concepts such as balance management and transfer events.

**Features:**  
- Store user token balances  
- Transfer tokens between addresses  
- View balances of any account  
- Event logging for transfers

**Tools Used:**  
- Solidity (version 0.8.x)  
- Remix IDE (for compilation and testing)

**How to Run:**  
1. Open `pro1.sol` in Remix IDE.  
2. Compile with Solidity compiler 0.8.x.  
3. Deploy using JavaScript VM.  
4. Use `balanceOf` to check balances and `transfer` to send tokens.
